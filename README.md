This is a fullstack application, broken down to two folders.

To run the app you can run the backend with the npm start command in it's folder,
and go to the root of localhost by the default port which you can set as a env variable PORT
or in the .env file in the server's folder.

Further explanation will be in the README.md files in the folders.
